You might consider using a Graph\ndatabase if you have a highly connected dataset or have queries with many joins.\n\n- [Download Neo4j Desktop](https://neo4j.com/download) _download Neo4j desktop or server editions_\n- [Neo4j Sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com) _pick a data set - no installation required_\n- [Neo4j Aura](https://neo4j.com/aura) _free Neo4j instance in the cloud_\n- [Neo4j GraphAcademy](https://neo4j.com/graphacademy) _free, self-paced, hands-on online training_\n- [GraphGists](https://neo4j.com/graphgists) _use ase and industry specific example graphs_\n\n### Graph Database Concepts\n\n|                       |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |\n| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| **Nodes**             | Nodes are commonly used to represent _entities_ or _things_ in your data. For example, a **Person** or **Movie**                                                                                                                         |\n| **Relationships**     | Relationships are used to connect two nodes together and organise the data into structure. For example, a Person **acted in** a movie. A relationship has a _type_ and _direction_, although the direction can be ignored at query time. |\n| **Labels**            | Labels are used to group nodes into categories. For example, a person may have `Person` and `Actor` labels.                                                                                                                              |\n| **Relationship Type** | Each relationship has a type. Relationships allow you to explore smaller sections of a graph.                                                                                                                                            |\n| **Properties**        | Both nodes and relationships can have properties set against them. Properties are [name-value pairs](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.3/syntax/values/#cypher-values).                                                             |\n\n## Neo4j Syntax\n\n### Read query structure\n\n```\n[USE]\n[MATCH WHERE]\n[OPTIONAL MATCH WHERE]\n[WITH [ORDER BY] [SKIP] [LIMIT]]\nRETURN [ORDER BY] [SKIP] [LIMIT]\n```\n\n### Write-only query structure\n\n```\n[USE]\n(CREATE | MERGE)*\n[SET|DELETE|REMOVE|FOREACH]*\n[RETURN [ORDER BY] [SKIP] [LIMIT]]\n```\n\n### Read-write query structure\n\n```\n[USE]\n[MATCH WHERE]\n[OPTIONAL MATCH WHERE]\n[WITH [ORDER BY] [SKIP] [LIMIT]]\n(CREATE | MERGE)*\n[SET|DELETE|REMOVE|FOREACH]*\n[RETURN [ORDER BY] [SKIP] [LIMIT]]\n```\n\n## Neo4j Reading Data\n\n### MATCH\n\n```\nMATCH (n:Person)-[:KNOWS]->(m:Person)\nWHERE n.name = 'Alice'\n```\n\nNode patterns can contain labels and properties.\n\n```\nMATCH (n)-->(m)\n```\n\nAny pattern can be used in MATCH.\n\n```\nMATCH (n {name: 'Alice'})-->(m)\n```\n\nPatterns with node properties.\n\n```\nMATCH p = (n)-->(m)\n```\n\nAssign a path to p.\n\n```\nOPTIONAL MATCH (n)-[r]->(m)\n```\n\nOptional pattern: nulls will be used for missing parts.\n\n### WHERE\n\n```\nWHERE n.property <> $value\n```\n\nUse a predicate to filter. Note that WHERE is always part of a MATCH, OPTIONAL MATCH or WITH clause. Putting it after a\ndifferent clause in a query will alter what it does.\n\n```\nWHERE EXISTS {\n  MATCH (n)-->(m) WHERE n.age = m.age\n}\n```\n\nUse an existential subquery to filter.\n\n### RETURN\n\n```\nRETURN *\n```\n\nReturn the value of all variables.\n\n```\nRETURN n AS columnName\n```\n\nUse alias for result column name.\n\n```\nRETURN DISTINCT n\n```\n\nReturn unique rows.\n\n```\nORDER BY n.property\n```\n\nSort the result.\n\n```\nORDER BY n.property DESC\n```\n\nSort the result in descending order.\n\n```\nSKIP $skipNumber\n```\n\nSkip a number of results.\n\n```\nLIMIT $limitNumber\n```\n\nLimit the number of results.\n\n```\nSKIP $skipNumber LIMIT $limitNumber\n```\n\nSkip results at the top and limit the number of results.\n\n```\nRETURN count(*)\n```\n\nThe number of matching rows. See Aggregating functions for more.\n\n### WITH\n\n```\nMATCH (user)-[:FRIEND]-(friend)\nWHERE user.name = $name\nWITH user, count(friend) AS friends\nWHERE friends > 10\nRETURN user\n```\n\nThe WITH syntax is similar to RETURN. It separates query parts explicitly, allowing you to declare which variables to\ncarry over to the next part.\n\n```\nMATCH (user)-[:FRIEND]-(friend)\nWITH user, count(friend) AS friends\nORDER BY friends DESC\n  SKIP 1\n  LIMIT 3\nRETURN user\n```\n\nORDER BY, SKIP, and LIMIT can also be used with WITH.\n\n### UNION\n\n```\nMATCH (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)\nRETURN b.name\nUNION\nMATCH (a)-[:LOVES]->(b)\nRETURN b.name\n```\n\nReturns the distinct union of all query results. Result column types and names have to match.\n\n```\nMATCH (a)-[:KNOWS]->(b)\nRETURN b.name\nUNION ALL\nMATCH (a)-[:LOVES]->(b)\nRETURN b.name\n```\n\nReturns the union of all query results, including duplicated rows.\n\n## Neo4j Writing Data\n\n### CREATE\n\n```\nCREATE (n {name: $value})\n```\n\nCreate a node with the given properties.\n\n```\nCREATE (n $map)\n```\n\nCreate a node with the given properties.\n\n```\nUNWIND $listOfMaps AS properties\nCREATE (n) SET n = properties\n```\n\nCreate nodes with the given properties.\n\n```\nCREATE (n)-[r:KNOWS]->(m)\n```\n\nCreate a relationship with the given type and direction; bind a variable to it.\n\n```\nCREATE (n)-[:LOVES {since: $value}]->(m)\n```\n\nCreate a relationship with the given type, direction, and properties.\n\n### SET\n\n```\nSET n.property1 = $value1,\n    n.property2 = $value2\n```\n\nUpdate or create a property.\n\n```\nSET n = $map\n```\n\nSet all properties. This will remove any existing properties.\n\n```\nSET n += $map\n```\n\nAdd and update properties, while keeping existing ones.\n\n```\nSET n:Person\n```\n\nAdds a label Person to a node.\n\n### MERGE\n\n```\nMERGE (n:Person {name: $value})\n  ON CREATE SET n.created = timestamp()\n  ON MATCH SET\n    n.counter = coalesce(n.counter, 0) + 1,\n    n.accessTime = timestamp()\n```\n\nMatch a pattern or create it if it does not exist. Use ON CREATE and ON MATCH for conditional updates.\n\n```\nMATCH (a:Person {name: $value1}),\n      (b:Person {name: $value2})\nMERGE (a)-[r:LOVES]->(b)\n```\n\nMERGE finds or creates a relationship between the nodes.\n\n```\nMATCH (a:Person {name: $value1})\nMERGE\n  (a)-[r:KNOWS]->(b:Person {name: $value3})\n```\n\nMERGE finds or creates paths attached to the node.\n\n### DELETE\n\n```\nDELETE n, r\n```\n\nDelete a node and a relationship.\n\n```\nDETACH DELETE n\n```\n\nDelete a node and all relationships connected to it.\n\n```\nMATCH (n)\nDETACH DELETE n\n```\n\nDelete all nodes and relationships from the database.\n\n### REMOVE\n\n```\nREMOVE n:Person\n```\n\nRemove a label from n.\n\n```\nREMOVE n.property\n```\n\nRemove a property.\n\n### FOREACH\n\n```\nFOREACH (r IN relationships(path) |\n  SET r.marked = true)\n```\n\nExecute a mutating operation for each relationship in a path.\n\n```\nFOREACH (value IN coll |\n CREATE (:Person {name: value}))\n```\n\nExecute a mutating operation for each element in a list.\n\n### CALL subquery\n\n```\nCALL {\n  MATCH (p:Person)-[:FRIEND_OF]->(other:Person) RETURN p, other\n  UNION\n  MATCH (p:Child)-[:CHILD_OF]->(other:Parent) RETURN p, other\n}\n```\n\nThis calls a subquery with two union parts. The result of the subquery can afterwards be post-processed.\n\n### CALL procedure\n\n```\nCALL db.labels() YIELD label\n```\n\nThis shows a standalone call to the built-in procedure db.labels to list all labels used in the database. Note that\nrequired procedure arguments are given explicitly in brackets after the procedure name.\n\n```\nCALL db.labels() YIELD *\n```\n\nStandalone calls may use YIELD \\* to return all columns.\n\n```\nCALL java.stored.procedureWithArgs\n```\n\nStandalone calls may omit YIELD and also provide arguments implicitly via statement parameters, e.g. a standalone call\nrequiring one argument input may be run by passing the parameter map {input: 'foo'}.\n\n```\nCALL db.labels() YIELD label\nRETURN count(label) AS count\n```\n\nCalls the built-in procedure db.labels inside a larger query to count all labels used in the database. Calls inside a\nlarger query always requires passing arguments and naming results explicitly with YIELD.\n\n### Import\n\n```\nLOAD CSV FROM\n'https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/4.3/csv/artists.csv' AS line\nCREATE (:Artist {name: line[1], year: toInteger(line[2])})\n```\n\nLoad data from a CSV file and create nodes.\n\n```\nLOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM\n'https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/4.3/csv/artists-with-headers.csv' AS line\nCREATE (:Artist {name: line.Name, year: toInteger(line.Year)})\n```\n\nLoad CSV data which has headers.\n\n```\nUSING PERIODIC COMMIT 500\nLOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM\n'https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/4.3/csv/artists-with-headers.csv' AS line\nCREATE (:Artist {name: line.Name, year: toInteger(line.Year)})\n```\n\nCommit the current transaction after every 500 rows when importing large amounts of data.\n\n```\nLOAD CSV FROM\n'https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/4.3/csv/artists-fieldterminator.csv'\nAS line FIELDTERMINATOR ';'\nCREATE (:Artist {name: line[1], year: toInteger(line[2])})\n```\n\nUse a different field terminator, not the default which is a comma (with no whitespace around it).\n\n```\nLOAD CSV FROM\n'https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/4.3/csv/artists.csv' AS line\nRETURN DISTINCT file()\n```\n\nReturns the absolute path of the file that LOAD CSV is processing, returns null if called outside of LOAD CSV context.\n\n```\nLOAD CSV FROM\n'https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-refcard/4.3/csv/artists.csv' AS line\nRETURN linenumber()\n```\n\nReturns the line number that LOAD CSV is currently processing, returns null if called outside of LOAD CSV context.\n\n### Operators\n\n|                        |                                           |\n| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |\n| **General**            | DISTINCT, ., []                           |\n| **Mathematical**       | +, -, \\*, /, %, ^                         |\n| **Comparison**         | =, <>, <, >, <=, >=, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL |\n| **Boolean**            | AND, OR, XOR, NOT                         |\n| **String**             | +                                         |\n| **List**               | +, IN, [x], [x .. y]                      |\n| **Regular Expression** | =~                                        |\n| **String matching**    | STARTS WITH, ENDS WITH, CONTAINS          |\n\n### null\n\n- `null` is used to represent missing/undefined values.\n\n- `null` is not equal to `null`. Not knowing two values does not imply that they are the same value. So the expression\n  `null = null` yields `null` and not `true`. To check if an expression is `null`, use `IS NULL`.\n- Arithmetic expressions, comparisons and function calls (except `coalesce`) will return `null` if any argument is\n  `null`.\n- An attempt to access a missing element in a list or a property that doesn’t exist yields `null`.\n- In `OPTIONAL MATCH` clauses, `nulls` will be used for missing parts of the pattern.\n\n### Patterns\n\n```\n(n:Person)\n```\n\nNode with Person label.\n\n```\n(n:Person:Swedish)\n```\n\nNode with both Person and Swedish labels.\n\n```\n(n:Person {name: $value})\n```\n\nNode with the declared properties.\n\n```\n()-[r {name: $value}]-()\n```\n\nMatches relationships with the declared properties.\n\n```\n(n)-->(m)\n```\n\nRelationship from n to m.\n\n```\n(n)--(m)\n```\n\nRelationship in any direction between n and m.\n\n```\n(n:Person)-->(m)\n```\n\nNode n labeled Person with relationship to m.\n\n```\n(m)<-[:KNOWS]-(n)\n```\n\nRelationship of type KNOWS from n to m.\n\n```\n(n)-[:KNOWS|:LOVES]->(m)\n```\n\nRelationship of type KNOWS or of type LOVES from n to m.\n\n```\n(n)-[r]->(m)\n```\n\nBind the relationship to variable r.\n\n```\n(n)-[*1..5]->(m)\n```\n\nVariable length path of between 1 and 5 relationships from n to m.\n\n```\n(n)-[*]->(m)\n```\n\nVariable length path of any number of relationships from n to m.

Invalid indexes return null. Slices can be\nretrieved with intervals from start_idx to end_idx, each of which can be omitted or negative. Out of range elements are\nignored.\n\n```\nUNWIND $names AS name\nMATCH (n {name: name})\nRETURN avg(n.age)\n```\n\nWith UNWIND, any list can be transformed back into individual rows. The example matches all names from a list of names.\n\n```\nMATCH (a)\nRETURN [(a)-->(b) WHERE b.name = 'Bob' | b.age]\n```\n\nPattern comprehensions may be used to do a custom projection from a match directly into a list.\n\n```\nMATCH (person)\nRETURN person { .name, .age}\n```\n\nMap projections may be easily constructed from nodes, relationships and other map values.\n\n### Maps\n\n```\n{name: 'Alice', age: 38,\n address: {city: 'London', residential: true}}\n```\n\nLiteral maps are declared in curly braces much like property maps. Lists are supported.\n\n```\nWITH {person: {name: 'Anne', age: 25}} AS p\nRETURN p.person.name\n```\n\nAccess the property of a nested map.\n\n```\nMERGE (p:Person {name: $map.name})\n  ON CREATE SET p = $map\n```\n\nMaps can be passed in as parameters and used either as a map or by accessing keys.\n\n```\nMATCH (matchedNode:Person)\nRETURN matchedNode\n```\n\nNodes and relationships are returned as maps of their data.\n\n```\nmap.name, map.age, map.children[0]\n```\n\nMap entries can be accessed by their keys. Invalid keys result in an error.\n\n### Predicates\n\n```\nn.property <> $value\n```\n\nUse comparison operators.\n\n```\ntoString(n.property) = $value\n```\n\nUse functions.\n\n```\nn.number >= 1 AND n.number <= 10\n```\n\nUse boolean operators to combine predicates.\n\n```\n1 <= n.number <= 10\n```\n\nUse chained operators to combine predicates.\n\n```\nn:Person\n```\n\nCheck for node labels.\n\n```\nvariable IS NOT NULL\n```\n\nCheck if something is not null, e.g. that a property exists.\n\n```\nn.property IS NULL OR n.property = $value\n```\n\nEither the property does not exist or the predicate is true.\n\n```\nn.property = $value\n```\n\nNon-existing property returns null, which is not equal to anything.\n\n```\nn[\"property\"] = $value\n```\n\nProperties may also be accessed using a dynamically computed property name.\n\n```\nn.property STARTS WITH 'Tim' OR\nn.property ENDS WITH 'n' OR\nn.property CONTAINS 'goodie'\n```\n\nString matching.\n\n```\nn.property =~ 'Tim.*'\n```\n\nString regular expression matching.\n\n```\n(n)-[:KNOWS]->(m)\n```\n\nEnsure the pattern has at least one match.\n\n```\nNOT (n)-[:KNOWS]->(m)\n```\n\nExclude matches to (n)-[:KNOWS]->(m) from the result.\n\n```\nn.property IN [$value1, $value2]\n```\n\nCheck if an element exists in a list.\n\n### List predicates\n\n```\nall(x IN coll WHERE x.property IS NOT NULL)\n```\n\nReturns true if the predicate is true for all elements in the list.\n\n```\nany(x IN coll WHERE x.property IS NOT NULL)\n```\n\nReturns true if the predicate is true for at least one element in the list.\n\n```\nnone(x IN coll WHERE x.property IS NOT NULL)\n```\n\nReturns true if the predicate is false for all elements in the list.\n\n```\nsingle(x IN coll WHERE x.property IS NOT NULL)\n```\n\nReturns true if the predicate is true for exactly one element in the list.\n\n### CASE\n\n```\nCASE n.eyes\n WHEN 'blue' THEN 1\n WHEN 'brown' THEN 2\n ELSE 3\nEND\n```\n\nReturn THEN value from the matching WHEN value. The ELSE value is optional, and substituted for null if missing.\n\n```\nCASE\n WHEN n.eyes = 'blue' THEN 1\n WHEN n.age < 40 THEN 2\n ELSE 3\nEND\n```\n\nReturn THEN value from the first WHEN predicate evaluating to true. Predicates are evaluated in order.\n\n### List expressions\n\n```\nsize($list)\n```\n\nNumber of elements in the list.\n\n```\nreverse($list)\n```\n\nReverse the order of the elements in the list.\n\n```\nhead($list), last($list), tail($list)\n```\n\nhead() returns the first, last() the last element of the list. tail() returns all but the first element.

This allows Cypher to re-use your queries instead of having to parse\n  and build new execution plans.\n- Always set an upper limit for your variable length patterns. It’s possible to have a query go wild and touch all nodes\n  in a graph by mistake.\n- Return only the data you need. Avoid returning whole nodes and relationships — instead, pick the data you need and\n  return only that.\n- Use `PROFILE` / `EXPLAIN` to analyze the performance of your queries. See\n  [Query Tuning](https://neo4j.com/docs/cypher-manual/4.3/query-tuning) for more information on these and other topics,\n  such as planner hints.\n\n## Neo4j Multidatabase\n\n### Database management\n\n```\nCREATE OR REPLACE DATABASE myDatabase\n```\n\n(★) Create a database named myDatabase.
