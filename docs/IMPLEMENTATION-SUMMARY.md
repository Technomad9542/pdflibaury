# Implementation Summary: Protected Routes with Google OAuth

## Overview
This implementation adds authentication protection to the PDF Library application, ensuring that only authenticated users can access the /library and /search pages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Authentication Hook (`src/hooks/useAuth.js`)
- Manages user authentication state
- Handles Google OAuth sign-in and sign-out
- Automatically redirects to /library after successful login
- Provides user data and loading states

### 2. Created Protected Route Component (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx`)
- Wraps protected routes to ensure only authenticated users can access them
- Shows loading state while checking authentication
- Displays access denied message for unauthenticated users
- Redirects unauthenticated users to the home page

### 3. Updated App Component (`src/App.jsx`)
- Wrapped Library and Search routes with ProtectedRoute component
- Maintains existing routing structure while adding protection

### 4. Updated Header Component (`src/components/Header.jsx`)
- Added logic to show "Login Required" indicators for protected routes when user is not authenticated
- Modified navigation to trigger Google login for protected routes when user is not authenticated
- Improved mobile navigation to handle protected routes appropriately

### 5. Documentation Updates
- Updated README.md to include information about protected routes
- Enhanced GOOGLE-OAUTH-SETUP.md with additional redirect URLs

## How It Works

1. **Unauthenticated Users**:
   - See "Login Required" indicators on Library and Search navigation items
   - Clicking these items triggers the Google OAuth login flow
   - Direct URL access to /library or /search redirects to home page with access denied message

2. **Authenticated Users**:
   - Can freely navigate to Library and Search pages
   - See their profile information in the header
   - Have access to logout functionality

3. **Login Flow**:
   - User clicks "Login with Google" button or tries to access a protected route
   - Google OAuth popup appears
   - After successful authentication, user is redirected to /library
   - User can now access all protected routes

4. **Logout Flow**:
   - User clicks "Logout" button in header
   - User session is terminated
   - User is redirected to home page
   - Access to protected routes is blocked again

## Files Created
- `src/hooks/useAuth.js` - Authentication hook
- `src/components/ProtectedRoute.jsx` - Protected route wrapper component
- `IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` - This file
- `GOOGLE-OAUTH-SETUP.md` - Google OAuth configuration guide

## Files Modified
- `src/App.jsx` - Added protected route wrappers
- `src/components/Header.jsx` - Added authentication-aware navigation
- `README.md` - Updated feature list
- `GOOGLE-OAUTH-SETUP.md` - Updated redirect URLs

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Visit the home page - should load normally
2. Try to access /library or /search directly - should redirect to home with access denied message
3. Click on Library or Search navigation items - should trigger Google login
4. After successful login, should be redirected to /library
5. Navigate to /library or /search - should load normally
6. Logout and try accessing protected routes again - should be blocked

## Security Notes
- All client-side route protection is implemented for user experience
- Server-side protection should still be implemented in Supabase RLS policies
- Redirect URLs must be properly configured in Supabase dashboard
