# Admin Feature Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds role-based access control to the PDF Library application, ensuring that the admin panel is only accessible to users whose email addresses exist in the admin_users table in Supabase.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Admin Data Service (`src/utils/adminDataService.js`)
- Added `isUserAdmin()` function to check if a user's email exists in the admin_users table
- Uses Supabase to query the admin_users table for the user's email
- Returns a boolean indicating whether the user is an admin

### 2. Updated Header Component (`src/components/Header.jsx`)
- Added state variables to track admin status and loading state
- Implemented useEffect hook to check admin status when user state changes
- Modified the admin button to only display when:
  - User is logged in
  - User's email exists in the admin_users table
  - Admin status check is complete (not loading)
- Updated mobile navigation to conditionally show admin panel button with same logic
- Removed the admin button from the CTA section in the middle of the header
- Added loading state handling for admin status check

### 3. Updated README (`README.md`)
- Added "Role-based Access" to the features list

## How It Works

1. **User Authentication**:
   - When a user logs in with Google OAuth, the application gets their email address

2. **Admin Status Check**:
   - When user state changes, the application checks if the user's email exists in the admin_users table
   - This check happens in the background and doesn't block the UI

3. **Admin Button Visibility**:
   - The admin button only appears in the header when:
     - The user is authenticated
     - The user's email is found in the admin_users table
     - The admin status check is complete
   - If any of these conditions are not met, the admin button is hidden

4. **Mobile Navigation**:
   - The same logic applies to the mobile admin panel button in the hamburger menu

## Files Modified
- `src/utils/adminDataService.js` - Added admin status checking function
- `src/components/Header.jsx` - Implemented conditional admin button display
- `README.md` - Updated features list

## Database Requirements
- A table named `admin_users` must exist in the Supabase database
- The table must have an `email` column to store admin user emails
- Admin user emails must be manually added to this table

## Testing
To test the implementation:
1. Log in with a user whose email is NOT in the admin_users table
   - Verify that no admin button appears in the header
2. Add the user's email to the admin_users table
   - Refresh the page or log out and back in
   - Verify that the admin button now appears in the header
3. Remove the user's email from the admin_users table
   - Refresh the page or log out and back in
   - Verify that the admin button is hidden again

## Security Notes
- All client-side checks are implemented for user experience
- Server-side protection should still be implemented in Supabase RLS policies for actual data protection
- The admin_users table should be protected with appropriate RLS policies to prevent unauthorized access
